# Turtle-game-challenge

This is a simple Python script that simulates a turtle race using the Turtle graphics library. The user can participate by placing a bet on a turtle of their choice and then watch the race unfold. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to learn programming concepts, especially for beginners.

Features:
User Interaction:

The user is prompted to make a bet on the turtle they think will win the race.
The program accepts the user's input for the chosen turtle's color.
Turtle Initialization:

Six turtles of different colors are created and positioned at the starting line.
Turtles are initialized with unique colors and starting positions.
Race Simulation:

The race begins when the user places a bet.
Turtles move forward by a random distance in each iteration.
The race continues until one of the turtles crosses the finish line (x-coordinate > 230).
Outcome Display:

The program determines the winning turtle based on its position.
If the user's bet matches the winning turtle's color, a victory message is displayed.
Otherwise, a message indicating the loss is shown.
